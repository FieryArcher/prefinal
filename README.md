# OMTS
#Backend project
The name of our project OMTS. 
The purpose of our site is to give people the opportunity to share their experience and communicate with each other. 
In our site, everyone can tell the situation through which he went through. Probably many have personal diaries for stories, 
but our site will be a diary for all users and a guide for the future.
